          We already know that JavaScript is a single-threaded language. That
          means the code is executed line by line and once the execution of one
          code is complete then only the next code of the program will be
          executed. When we make a request to the HTTP server that will take
          more time. So the next statement after the HTTP request has to wait
          for the execution. It will only get executed when the HTTP request
          completes. <br />
          We can say that the synchronized code is blocked in nature. This is
          the way the asynchronous programs came into the picture. Asynchronous
          code executing in the background without blocking the execution of the
          code in the main thread. Asynchronous code is non-blocking. That means
          we can make HTTP requests asynchronously.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md font-normal mb-2">
          Using an asynchronous program we can perform long network requests
          without blocking the main thread. There are 2 ways in which we can do
          that.
