      <h6 class="text-sm">why we use Service?</h6>
      <p class="text-sm">
         Code Organization: <br>

         Services help in organizing and structuring your code. By separating concerns and placing related functionality
         in a
         service, you can keep your components lean and focused on the user interface. <br>
         Reuse and Shareability: <br>

         Services allow you to write code that can be reused across multiple components or even throughout the entire
         application. This promotes a modular and maintainable codebase.<br>
         Singleton Pattern:<br>

         Angular services are typically created as singleton instances. This means that there is only one instance of a
         service
         throughout the application. This can be beneficial for maintaining state and sharing data across different
         parts of your
         app.<br>
         Dependency Injection:<br>

         Angular has a powerful dependency injection system, and services are injectable objects. Dependency injection
         makes it
         easy to manage the dependencies between different parts of your application, making your code more testable and
         scalable.<br>
         Separation of Concerns: <br>

         Services help in separating business logic, data manipulation, and other non-UI concerns from the components.
         This
         promotes a clean and maintainable architecture.<br>
         State Management: <br>

         Services are often used for managing application state. You can store and manage data in a service, making it
         accessible
         to different components. This is particularly useful for maintaining a centralized state that can be easily
         synchronized
         across the application.<br>
         HTTP Communication:<br>

         Services are commonly used to make HTTP requests and handle communication with a server. This allows you to
         encapsulate
         the data-fetching logic in a single service, making it easier to manage and update.
         Lifecycle Hooks: <br>

         Services in Angular can make use of lifecycle hooks, such as OnInit and OnDestroy, allowing you to perform
         actions when
         a service is instantiated or destroyed.
